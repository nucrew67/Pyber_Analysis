# Election Audit Summary
The election script that was created can be modified for any future election campaigns to show voter turnouts, votes that were casts, and can 
be easily modified to for unlimited election results. 

* A list that will show voter age can be created with a list and dictionary age(), age_votes[]
* Extract age from the database age_name = row[x]
* Count the number of votes by age_votes

Another example can be created with user input by year.
* print("What year do you want?"), Year = ("2019","2020","2021")
