# Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis 

1.	Overview of the analysis: 
The goal of this data analysis project for Pyber, a ride-sharing software startup, is to undertake a ride-sharing study in order to examine rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. The rideshare data research begins with a comparison of two datasets: ride data, which includes the location, fare, and date for each ride, and city data, which includes the city type and number of drivers. When a visualization of the ridesharing research concluded with a line graph depicting the type of rideshare setting, which was: a) urban, b) suburban, and c) rural, the rideshare study analysis goal was completed. Jupyter Notebook, pandas, and matplotllib libraries were used in the analysis study.

2.	Results: 
According to the findings of the Pyber rideshare study, there was a broad variety of rates and ride disparities between rural cities versus urban cities. In major cities, for example, there were 1625 rides compared to only 125 in rural cities. In addition, there were 2,405 drivers in urban areas and 78 drivers in rural areas. Total fares in urban regions were likewise higher, at $39,854.38 against $4,327.93 in rural areas. According to this data, ride-sharing start-up companies in urban areas had higher overall fares and profits than those in suburban and rural locations.
 

3.	Summary: 
While the rides in large centers generate more income, the rides in rural cities are more profitable. As a result, I'd concentrate on increasing the profitability of metropolitan city journeys.
I believe that the number of drivers in urban areas should be reduced. There are 2,405 drivers, however only 1,625 rides were completed. Because of this, not every driver has completed at least one ride. Reducing the number of drivers will raise the average fare per driver, which is currently 3.4 times lower than in rural cities.
Additional ride time analysis is required. Calculating the average fare per minute or per kilometer and comparing the figure among city types may be instructive. If the fee for a one-minute ride in rural cities is much greater than in urban cities, the ride fare for urban city types may be increased. It contributes to raising the average fare per journey in metropolitan areas and generating additional cash.
